1)The data fetched from the endpoint was very big so I implemented pagination to prevent long scrolling. 
2)I added features to sort columns alphabetically and search by name to manage the large amount of data effectively.
2)I used Photopea to extract the fonts, colors, and sizes from the template.
3)I ensured the app to be responsive to ensure a seamless experience across different screen sizes.
